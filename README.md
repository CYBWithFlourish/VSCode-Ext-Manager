## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your system.
-   The `code` command-line tool must be available in your PATH. You can add it by opening the Command Palette in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and typing `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`.

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository or download the `vscode-ext-manager.sh` script to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CYBWithFlourish/VSCode-Ext-Manager.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x vscode-ext-manager.sh
    ```

### Usage

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
./vscode-ext-manager.sh
```

You will be presented with a menu of options to choose from.

#### Dry Run Mode

To see what the script *would* do without actually uninstalling or installing any extensions, use the `--dry-run` flag:

```bash
./vscode-ext-manager.sh --dry-run
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

You can customize the lists of extensions directly within the script:

-   `KEEP_EXTENSIONS`: This array contains the extension IDs that will be protected from uninstallation. This is ideal for your essential Sui Move development extensions.
-   `INSTALL_LIST`: This array contains a list of extensions that you can choose to install.
-   `*_PROFILE`: These arrays define the extensions for different development profiles (e.g., `PYTHON_PROFILE`, `FLUTTER_PROFILE`).

To find the ID of an extension, navigate to its page in the VS Code Marketplace. The ID is typically in the format `publisher.extension-name`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Menu Options

1.  **Install extensions from list:** Choose from the `INSTALL_LIST` to install extensions individually or all at once.
2.  **Uninstall all except Sui Move dev extensions:** Cleans your VS Code setup by removing all extensions not in the `KEEP_EXTENSIONS` list.
3.  **Add extension to install or keep list:** Add new extension IDs to the `INSTALL_LIST` or `KEEP_EXTENSIONS` list.
4.  **Export current extensions to file:** Saves a list of all your currently installed extensions to a `vscode-extensions.txt` file.
5.  **Reset all extensions:** A dangerous option that will uninstall *all* of your extensions.
6.  **Show extension stats:** Displays a summary of your installed, kept, and to-be-removed extensions.
7.  **Smart suggestions:** Checks if any of the essential `KEEP_EXTENSIONS` are missing from your setup.
8.  **Install by profile:** Quickly install a group of extensions defined in a profile (e.g., Python, AI).
9.  **Search extensions:** Search for an extension within the `INSTALL_LIST`.
10. **Sync from remote URL:** Install extensions from a list hosted at a given URL.
